# arcade

Project written in [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/) using [pygame 1.9.6](https://www.pygame.org/).

This is my attempt ot become more familiar with Python3. I have been using pygame as it is fairly well documented and is adequate for the needs of these games.

Currently all games consist of one .py script which can be executed to run the game.
